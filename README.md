# Web Scraping and Data Processing Project

Welcome to the `web-scraping-and-data-processing` repository! This project is designed to scrape product information from websites and process the data for further use. The main components of this project include a Python script (`main.py`), a Jupyter notebook (`scrapping.ipynb`), and a JSONL file containing the scraped product information (`product_info.jsonl`).

## Overview

The `web-scraping-and-data-processing` project demonstrates how to scrape product information from websites and process it into a structured format. The project uses a combination of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for scraping and processing data, and stores the results in a JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) file.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- BeautifulSoup4
- Requests
- Pandas

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

## Usage
### Jupyter Notebook
Open the Jupyter notebook to explore and run the web scraping process interactively:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook

2. Open scrapping.ipynb in your browser.

3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to configure the scraping process and scrape data.

## Python Script
To run the data processing using the Python script:

1. Make sure product_info.jsonl contains the scraped data.
2. Execute the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py


This will process the data in product_info.jsonl and produce any specified outputs or analyses.

## Project Structure
`main.py`: Python script to process the scraped product data.
`product_info.jsonl`: JSON Lines file containing the scraped product information.
`requirements.txt`: File listing all the dependencies for the project.
`scrapping.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for interactive web scraping and data collection.
